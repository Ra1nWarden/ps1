1. User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/32.0.1700.77 Safari/537.36
Mozilla is the creator of Firefox. Macintosh is the full name for Mac. Intel is the company that produced the CPU for my computer. Mac OS X 10_9_1 is the name and verson of the operating system I am using. I am not sure what AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) means. Chrome is the browser I am using to for the connection with the server. Safari is a built-in browser for all Macs. It might be a "base" browser for any other browsers running on a Mac.

2. It is unsafe because if global static variables could be easily modified in this way, then some crucial information may be modified as well to crash the system. For example, if the port number could be changed as well, then the whole server will be down. As a result, modifying static global variables is not allowed.
